        For XTZ, `tokenId` is left empty for FA1.2 tokens and must have a value for FA2 tokens
        For ALGO, we either need a tokenId which is the `assetId` for algorand, or we need a `contractAddress` (creator address) and a `symbol` (unit name), which will be used to identify the asset.

        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
        payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
        an HTML page.


        This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
        the request as well as the response.

        It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
        wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

        Example:

            message GetResourceRequest {
              // A unique request id.
              string request_id = 1;

              // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
              google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;
            }

            service ResourceService {
              rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns
              (google.protobuf.Empty);
            }

        Example with streaming methods:

            service CaldavService {
              rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
            }

        Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
        handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.

        - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs

        # Overview

        The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        [google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code], but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.

        # Language mapping

        The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.

        # Other uses

        The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        consistent developer experience across different environments.

        Example uses of this error model include:

        - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
            it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
            errors.

        - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
            have a `Status` message for error reporting.

        - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
            `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
            each error sub-response.

        - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
            results in its response, the status of those operations should be
            represented directly using the `Status` message.

        - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
            be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
    protobufAny:
      type: object
      properties:
        '@type':
          type: string
          description: |-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
            type.googleapis.com.

            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
            used with implementation specific semantics.

        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

        Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

        Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
        name "y.z".


        JSON

        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }
    protobufNullValue:
      type: string
      description: |-
        `NullValue` is a singleton enumeration to represent the null value for the
        `Value` type union.

         The JSON representation for `NullValue` is JSON `null`.
